# Board Game Project

Board game project developed incrementally in C#. Version 1 focuses solely on dice rolling, with plans to expand to a full turn-based game in future versions.

## Versioning Strategy

- **v1.0 (Current)**  
  - Dice-rolling functionality only  
  - Prints two dice values to the console  
  - Grants a single bonus roll if double sixes are rolled  

- **v2.0 (Planned)**  
  - Player management and turns  
  - Board positions and movement  
  - Scoring and win conditions  
  - Refactor into object-oriented design

## How to Run v1

1. Open `csharp/v1/BoardGame.cs` in Visual Studio or VS Code with C# support.  
2. Build the project.  
3. Run the program.  
4. Observe the dice roll output in the console.
